## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies statistical analysis, A/B testing, and data visualization to evaluate whether a new landing page for an online news portal (**E-news Express**) is effective in increasing subscriber conversions.

The simulated dataset includes key metrics such as conversion status and time spent on the page, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of the new design.  
In addition, the project analyzes how conversion rates vary based on users’ preferred language.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Compare conversion rates between the old and new landing pages  
- Perform hypothesis testing to evaluate statistical significance  
- Analyze time spent on the page  
- Study the relationship between preferred language and conversion  
- Support business decision-making using statistical evidence  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains information related to:
- User conversion status  
- Time spent on the landing page  
- Preferred language  
- Page version (control vs treatment)  

*(Dataset is simulated and provided as part of the course project.)*
